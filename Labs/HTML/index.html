        <h2>History</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                Ethereum was initially described in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin, a programmer and co-founder of Bitcoin Magazine,
                in late 2013 with a goal of building decentralized applications.<br> Buterin argued that <b>Bitcoin</b> and blockchain technology could benefit from
                other applications besides money and needed a scripting language for application development that could lead to
                attaching real-world assets, such as stocks and property, to the blockchain. In 2013, Buterin briefly worked with eToro
                CEO Yoni Assia on the Colored Coins project and drafted its white paper outlining additional use cases for blockchain
                technology. However, after failing to gain agreement on how the project should proceed, he proposed the development
                of a new platform with a more general scripting language that would eventually become Ethereum.

                    In 2016, a hacker exploited a flaw in a third-party project called The DAO and stole <b>$50 million</b> of Ether.
                    As a result, the Ethereum community voted to hard fork the blockchain to reverse the theft and Ethereum Classic (ETC) continued as the original chain.
